This repo regards the software implementation of the framework.

## Motivation
Upon reflecting on the finished framework, it was clear that the efforts to uphold comprehensiveness could potential be perceived as a downfall, in respect to the number of challenges that arise when attempting to apply manually, namely the complexity and time it takes to apply. This is an unintended consequence, as the framework was envisioned to aid users quickly through the resource recovery potential identification process. Consequently, computer aided functionalities were deemed as a necessary addition to streamline the process, thus TaskGen was conceived.

## Overview
TaskGen is a tool created to aid users through the conceived resource recovery framework. When using the tool many of the aforementioned framework steps can be completed rapidly with use of the tool, thus drastically decreasing complexity and increasing ease of application. TaskGen facilitates swift generation of feasible flowsheets, thus allowing users to assess possibilities that may not have been previously considered, and eliminate unsuitable candidates early the evaluation process. A demonstration of how framework implementation is assisted with the use of TaskGen can be seen as follows;
